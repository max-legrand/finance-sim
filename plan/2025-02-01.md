First getting started on the project.
- [x] bootstrapped the project w/ nix
- [x] setup repo
- [x] Implement basic data model
- [x] Set up basic skeleton of a CLI
   ( This was taken from some other throwaway project I was working on)
- [x] Begin working on the data parsing
    -> Starting with CSV, then JSON, then API; I'm hoping that the API data can be easily transformed into an
       agreeable format so that I can just re-use the JSON or CSV parsing functions.
